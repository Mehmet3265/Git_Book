Here I created a new pace in chapter 2 to fetch it from the local repository.

That is the point. creating file out of a package(chapter)  was a mistake.


With the new changes in the page I need to update locall repository.
Now I will change it.

but first I need to commit. Or the team mates need to commit the change in the page downside.
